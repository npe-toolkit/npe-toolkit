# Contributing to the NPE Toolkit

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. [Integration tests](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/facebookincubator/npe-toolkit)
   should automatically run when you create your PR.
3. Additionally, we use consistent formatting across the repo via Prettier. You
   can format your project by running `tools/project/prettify.sh`.
4. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Coding Style

We have eslint rules set up that should be used to autoformat files before
submission. This works best if you have your IDE set up to autoformat on save,
but you can also run`tools/project/prettify.sh`.

## License
